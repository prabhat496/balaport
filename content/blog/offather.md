I didn't have it in me to look him in the eye and say these three golden words - Happy Father's Day, Pappa! We don't share that kind of relationship anymore.

I miss the good old days - I could lay across your chest in the whitest of underpants listening to your Kauwa and Maina - none of them be evil to emphasize on the moral - you'd always fall asleep in the middle and we'd never reach the end. I wasn't exactly the most happy child but I was content. I see how you've pushed us for better from whereverâ€‹ you came. That's phenomenal and you have my respect for it.

I grew up. You grew old. Things changed. Our principles of living never met on the same page. If only you could see through my eyes - 'cause I'd never be able to see through yours. I've grown up to be a headstrong lady, Pappa and I don't know how to bend to your ways of living, they don't make sense to me anymore. 

I am glad you brought me up. I am so glad you taught me how to think and then, be assertive of what feels right. I'm glad we could argue to see the reason but then, with the little time we have got - I can't see us bickering all the time.

You have me, unconditionally. That, this reverse parenthood with a long distance factor is a tad bit tiresome but I am glad I am able to do whatever I can when you need me. Be it your recharges, or your online deliveries that you insist on not needing, or flying down to you whenever you need me at hospitals. I promise I'll do it all. 

But I don't promise to bend to your ways of living. That I am glad you pushed me for good. And now I am pushing for better. You'll just have to sit back, and believe in me. And I'll take care - of all of it. Of all of you. Of all the smiles we've got through years.

I love you Pappa!

Oh, and we missed mother here.

Sometime soon!

Baua

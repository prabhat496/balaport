I was working on a webpage when the train came whistling to the platform. I stood up sliding forth my trolley, and took a moment to move it to the raised train bogie. Just two hours and I'll be home! 
'Jaldi chadhiye madam. Nahi to aapka pani hum pee lenge.’ 

It took me a moment to decipher that it didn't have anything to do with the gravity working on my green bottle. I turned back, stern - it wasn't fear, neither courage. He was quick to defend himself citing his thirst until he took a step back. Perhaps my turning back was a revelation. I went ahead and sat close to a bunch of middle aged men. That could be my safest choice on an half-empty early morning train. He took a seat right next to them, greeted them with a 'Jai Shri Ram’. They shared a laugh discussing the usual NaMo-RaGa. He left soon after and I never reported him.

It wasn't fear. It wasn't courage. Neither was it shame or 'log kya kahenge’! It was just a rational voice telling me that the effort would be a futile one. That things wouldn't change. That some perverts would keep intruding with sexually offending remarks and would keep getting away with that. It has happened before. It will keep happening. In the schools. In the safest of homes. In the buses and trains.

I am typing this on the same train. The fields are passing by. It's home in a couple more hours. It isn't the first time on a train. I have faced it before, millions face it daily. Oh, and I have been lucky to avoid a scene so far, just like today.

I belong to a middle class family - our dreams are usually driven by a budget marked with upgraded eras. We got a black and white television in the early 90s - invitations to a community binge watch session for Ramayana on Sundays were a thing then. Then we got a scooter somewhere in the late 90s and finally, my family could travel together on the two wheeler adjusting babies in between my parents. Upgradation to a color television, a refrigerator, or even a miniscule mixer grinder were made in between the late 00s. I remember each occasion when we welcomed something esteemed to be luxurious - remarkably, they'd all be done during festivals which granted bonus from my father's employer. But all the happiness wasn't owed to budgets only.

They were a family of 5 before I arrived but were happy to welcome me in their constrained 2BHK company quarter. I was the first baby to have been treated with the Johnson and Johnson baby products in the family. Yeah, recognising brands would be a big thing in my family. I wouldn't say I was much of an economic burden but having a family of six wasn't certainly easy for them. I remember their budgeting process to make both ends meet but that'd not put them down. Rather, they treated me with everything they thought to be elite, even the much sought after independence to handle my own self which was seldom granted to my elder sisters. I don't remember asking for their permission for a sleep-over at my friend's or any outings planned. They had a curfew timing but I don't remember adhering to any and it was fun growing up like that. I was glad that I had their trust and it made me a responsible teenager. Experiences like these taught me to be responsible for my own safety, I could handle money without overspending and most of all, I became someone who could think independently and it has been so helpful in shaping me up.

We recently upgraded to a car. I'd not say it is a luxurious one but it fits all of us well. My father tricked me into learning how to drive a car since we couldn't afford to keep a driver. I am also responsible to wash and maintain it - uh, yes, I am also an independent woman who knows how to drive and take care of her finances. Little luxuries of budgeting you see!

And we met on the stairs - barely registering her presence, I moved my trolley upstairs to shift in this new place in a city I had rarely been to before. I hadn’t told my parents, very few friends knew where I was headed to and even fewer knew about my plans of quitting DU. That one fine day, I had woken up to myself in a tiny room at North Campus to realise that it didn’t make sense to me anymore. I packed my bags, made arrangements to move to an unknown city where I had enrolled in a coaching centre to prepare for an entrance exam that I was chasing for years. 

The city was nothing like the places I lived in previously. A tier-three city with a crowd I was totally unfamiliar with except for the language and food - I was reluctant on establishing familiarities at first, that I was mostly uninterested in people if not alienated. That the only road I was familiar with in town led to my preparatory classes. And there I saw her again, right beneath the angular space those stairs made. Trimmed white hair on her head with an unusually wrapped saree around the waist, she was adorable beyond effort. We exchanged glances and I smiled at her. Her eyes gleamed with a smile that she sported my way. So she didn’t have any teeth and yet adorned such a dazzling smile. A few steps closer, I waved my hands at her and walked away. This became our morning ritual till a fateful Sunday evening.

I didn’t have my classes that day and I was heading upstairs when I saw her again. I smiled at her, only to register a gravitated dull face touching the floor. I waved at her as she held my hands, asking me to sit with a gesture I hadn’t anticipated. I looked at her and she moved her hands in a language I didn’t know. It was something to do with her grief and I let her lean on my shoulder while I supported her back with my hand. She let out a gasp as she sobbed silently on my shoulder. We hugged for a while and she held back herself with strength. We looked each other in the eye and exchanged that familiar smile. Something changed - within me, within her. That we weren’t mere strangers crossing our paths on stairs, that we hadn’t spoken a word but could share our inexplicable emptiness. That evening, she held my hands tight for one more time before I walked away.

In the following weeks, I learned her story from my neighbours and the landlady. She was mute and deaf, lost her on her way back from work. The landlords were kind enough to provide her with food but miser enough to put her in a shabby corner space that those stairs made - there were empty rooms all over the compound. That was thirty years ago and she was now here - in a city that she barely would have called her own, surviving on the kindness they threw at ostracised. 

Those following mornings we worked on our special morning ritual - that I’d hold out my hands for her and she’d grab it at once, laughing like never before. I’d smile back and keep walking. My days weren’t good either, that the lies and uncertainties that enveloped my future were too much to bear but with her by my mornings, I could keep going. She was the magic to my wand. 

This, on RHS, is us on the night before I left the city - a city I still couldn’t call my own but was familiar with through the windows this lady opened up for me. I love her, I think she loves me too in some corner of her heart - my city.
